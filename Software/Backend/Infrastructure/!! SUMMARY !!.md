# Server Manager

The Server Manager will be able to do following things:

- Create, Stop, Restart and Delete the Server (or the Docker Container)
- Update the Server Software
- Auto Plugin/Mod updates (if enabled)
- Load and Save Server Templates (Made by us and the community)
- Automatic Backups (if enabled)
- Save/Update modified files
- REST API to manage everything [RESTAPI](Rest%20API)

Wings-Like Features:

- Fetch CPU, RAM and Storage usage
- Create a Docker Container where the server is stored in and give the option to delete it.

POTENTIALLY:

- Custom Forks of Paper, Purpur, Fabric, SpongeMC, etc. where auto updates are built in.
